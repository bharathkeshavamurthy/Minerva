From \verb+http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=1&chapter=1&version=50+:

\begin{quote}
    1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
    2 The earth was without form,
    and void;
    and darkness was on the face of the deep.
    And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.

    3 Then God said,``Let there be light'';
    and there was light.
    4 And God saw the light,
    that it was good;
    and God divided the light from the darkness.
    5 God called the light Day,
    and the darkness He called Night.
    So the evening and the morning were the first day.
