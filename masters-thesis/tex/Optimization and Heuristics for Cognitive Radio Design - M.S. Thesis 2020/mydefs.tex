%  Command definitions that can be used in all documents that have
%      \input{mydefs}
%

% CHANGE NEXT 3 LINES?
% Define \be and \ee to start and end the equation environment.
\newcommand{\be}{\begin{equation}}
\newcommand{\ee}{\end{equation}}

% CHANGE NEXT 12 LINES?
% Define \Repeat so, for example,
%     \Repeat{whatever}{10}
% is the same as typing whatever 10 times.
\newcount{\myi}
\newcommand{\Repeat}[2]{%
    \myi=0
    \loop
        \ifnum\myi<#2
        #1
        \advance\myi by 1
    \repeat
}

% CHANGE NEXT 3 LINES?
% Make "\Sum ab" or "\Sum{a}{b}" do "\sum_{a}^{b}".
% This can only be used when in math mode.
\newcommand\Sum[2]{\sum_{#1}^{#2}}

% CHANGE NEXT 4 LINES?
% Make "\xn" do "$x_n$".
% Because this definition contains the "$" to go into math mode
% this definition must be used when not in math mode.
\newcommand{\xn}{$x_n$}

% CHANGE NEXT 5 LINES?
% Since \xn is already defined we must use \renewcommand to redefine it.
% Normally you would not have the above definition for \xn in this file
% if you were just going to override it later.
% The \ensuremath goes into math mode if not already in math mode.
\renewcommand{\xn}{\ensuremath{x_n}}
