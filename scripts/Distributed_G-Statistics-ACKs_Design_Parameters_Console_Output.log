Design Parameters:
1. A robust FSK common control channel (short control frames)
2. RSSI-based Neighbor discovery
3. Preferential-ballot based channel access rank/order allocation
4. AWGN observation model with Rayleigh channel fading model
5. Greedy Distributed Learning under Pre-allocation (channel access ranks assigned via collaboration; remaining operations opportunistic): $\epsilon$-greedy policy with channel choice dictated by the allocated access rank--choose from ranked list of channels, ranked in the decreasing order of their availabilities
6. Distributed Learning under allocation(completely opportunistic behavior): Channel choice dictated by randomness and ACKs--choose from ranked list of channels, ranked in the decreasing order of their g-statistics
7. Same double Markov chain time-frequency correlation structure
8. SU Throughput and PU Interference analysis
9. $18$ radios in total distilled down to an ensemble of $12$ radios using the RSSI-based neighbor discovery scheme, $18$ channels, $3$ incumbents, $3000$ time-steps, $3000$ samplings per time-step for channel-specific threshold based occupancy detection at each local node (no information exchange among nodes)
10. False alarm probability of $30$\% for threshold-based occupancy detection (in line with my other Neyman-Pearson analysis)
11. CORRELATION_MODEL = {'p00': 0.1, 'p01': 0.3, 'p10': 0.3, 'p11': 0.7, 'q0': 0.3, 'q1': 0.8}
12. Steady-state occupancy probability = 0.6
