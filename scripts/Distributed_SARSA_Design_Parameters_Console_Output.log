Design Parameters:
1. A robust FSK common control channel (short control frames)
2. RSSI-based Neighbor discovery
3. Preferential-ballot based channel access rank/order allocation
4. Random shuffling of local decision making prior to sending the actions and test statistics out to its neighbors over the common control channel
5. AWGN observation model with Rayleigh channel fading model
6. $\epsilon$-greedy policy dictating TD-SARSA with Linear Function Approximation (from the paper) with $\epsilon{=}0.01$, 
7. Same double Markov chain time-frequency correlation structure
8. Simplified belief update heuristics with $\lambda{=}0.9$ (from the paper)
9. SU Throughput and PU Interference analysis
10. $18$ radios in total distilled down to an ensemble of $12$ radios using the RSSI-based neighbor discovery scheme, $18$ channels, $3$ incumbents, $3000$ time-steps, $3000$ samplings per time-step for channel-specific threshold based occupancy detection at each local node based on the test-statistics for this channel received from its neighbors
11. This channel-specific threshold also depends on the channel-specific false alarm probability--that's dictated by number of nodes sensing this particular channel in this time-step
12. Additionally, the feature vector update in TD-SARSA incorporates this channel-specific false alarm probability--that's again dictated by the number of nodes sensing this particular channel in this time-step
13. Raw false alarm probability of $5$\%
14. Discount factor of $\gamma{=}0.9$ in the SARSA parameter update (from the paper)
15. CORRELATION_MODEL = {'p00': 0.1, 'p01': 0.3, 'p10': 0.3, 'p11': 0.7, 'q0': 0.3, 'q1': 0.8}
16. Steady-state occupancy probability = 0.6
